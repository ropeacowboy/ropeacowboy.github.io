    <h2> Here are some links to websites that I think are set up rather well. </h2>
             </header>
        
            <p>I like these websites because they are engaging and interesting. There are moving slide shows that engage the browser, but it is not too in-your-face or pretentious. The navigation is uniquely planned so that the viewer does not get lost, and it is easy to back track.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.thefwa.com"> thefwa</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.siteinspire.com"> site inspire</a></li>
    <ol> 
        <li> I like that this site has a slide show, with a simple gray background to make the pictures seem more colorful and interesting. </li>
        <li> There are tons more scrollable content down below, in case the browser is not interested in clicking right away.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.popsci.com"> Popular Science</a></li>
        <ol>
            <li> This site has a simple soothing layout, with a beautiful background photo and articles to scroll through.</li>
            <li>The scrolling system is also clever because the background photo fades as the user scrolls down. It will be noted that I want to learn how to do this.</li>
            <li>Also a site about new science is kind of badass.</li>

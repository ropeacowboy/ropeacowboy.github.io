    <p> My name is Rachael Hatcher. </p>
    <p> I am 21 years old and my favorite color is purple. I love to write in my free time and hope to set up my own blog/website soon. </p>
        <p>I am a junior this year and just switched from film to graphic design. Thankfully I have not wasted a lot of time!</p>
